SQL for Data Science Final Project

In this project, I have profiled and analyzed the Yelp dataset as part of a certificate course "SQL for Data Science" offered by UC Davis. <br>
As part of the final assignment, I made predicitions of the success of a business based on the rating of the reviews on different scales (how useful, funny and cool a business is).
